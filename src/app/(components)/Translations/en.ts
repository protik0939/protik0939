  "blogs.myjourneyinphitron.title": "Phitron and Problem Solving",
  "blogs.myjourneyinphitron.fulldetails": "Assalamu Alaikum, I am Sadat Alam Protik, a student of Phitron Batch-2. Through this post, I will share the story of how someone like me—who once knew nothing about Codeforces or CodeChef—has now achieved a 1200+ (Pupil) rating on Codeforces and a 1400+ (2-Star) rating on CodeChef. I will also share how I solved 200+ problems related to Data Structures and Algorithms, and over 350 problems across all online programming platforms. Additionally, I will share the story of an amazing journey with Phitron from the very beginning until now. \nWhen I got admitted to university, I learned about the Phitron course from my elder brother. I enrolled immediately, and thus began our long journey. It is worth mentioning that I had absolutely no idea about Competitive Programming at that time. I had heard from a university friend that aspiring programmers participate in contests on a platform called Codeforces. But when I visited Codeforces back then, I couldn't understand anything about how it worked. And I didn't even know about CodeChef. \Anyway, I learned C Programming at Phitron. With excellent classes, support sessions twice a day, and a live class once a week, my programming learning journey continued in a truly impeccable environment. Then came learning C++, Data Structures, and Algorithms. Along with this, the instructors introduced us to various online judges right from the start. There were daily quizzes after classes, as well as weekly exams, assignments, and contests. Over a period of 7 months, thanks to the tireless efforts of the respected teachers who took classes and assisted us in support sessions, I finally succeeded in mastering almost the entirety of programming—starting from that simple one-line code printf(\"Hello World!\");. \n Then began the journey of Competitive Programming. The \"Xettabytes Programming Club\" was formed with 50+ young programmers selected from among us. We had weekly live classes (where new problem-solving tricks were taught and demonstrated by solving problems), daily tasks to solve 4-7 problems, and we had to submit forms reporting whether we completed the tasks, how many we solved, or why we couldn't solve them. There were also daily support sessions, regular contests on Codeforces or CodeChef, and weekly Phitron contests. Additionally, we had special guideline sessions with respected senior programmers, where their experiences helped light our path. \nFinally, after about 3+ months of this Competitive Programming journey, I have been able to achieve Pupil (1200+ Rating) on Codeforces and Two Star (1400+ Rating) on CodeChef. Besides, I have solved 350+ problems across platforms like Codeforces, CodeChef, AtCoder, SPOJ, etc. I also solved 200+ problems specifically related to Data Structures and Algorithms. \nOur course journey is nearing its end. However, the respected instructors of the XPSC Club have announced that they will continue to provide all kinds of support to those who wish to continue Competitive Programming on their own. Finding such a platform is a huge blessing that cannot be expressed in words. I must mention one person—Jhankar Mahbub Sir. Despite being an incredibly busy person, he always checked in on us and often provided all sorts of help in special guideline sessions. I am eternally grateful to him and the entire Phitron team. \nThere is no end to learning. I heard somewhere that a great person once said, \"I can do everything, yet I know nothing.\" We are the same. Our learning continues from birth to death. What I have achieved on Codeforces or CodeChef is not the end; I must continue the tireless effort to achieve even better ratings. \nIf we compare ourselves to a tree, the Phitron team planted my roots, gave me fertilizer and water, made me capable of growing, and helped spread my branches. Now it is time for me to spread my branches even further. If I find anything else to learn, I will definitely learn it. I want to say once again, I am eternally grateful to the entire Phitron Team for building this foundation of my life, and I send love from the bottom of my heart to the whole team.\nCodeforces Username: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://codeforces.com/profile/protik0939\">protik0939</a>\nCodechef username: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.codechef.com/users/protik0939\">protik0939</a>",

  "blogs.medibot.title": "MediBot",
  "blogs.medibot.fulldetails": "MediBot: Our Smart Line-Following Robot for Modernizing Hospital Healthcare\nBackground:\nThe busy hospital corridors, the relentless rushing of nurses, and the challenge of delivering the right medication to the right patient at the right time—this scene is familiar to us all. Especially since COVID-19, we have realized how crucial it is to minimize human contact in cases of infectious diseases or within isolation wards. To address this problem with a smart and automated solution, we, a group of students from Daffodil International University, have developed \"MediBot\". My friends and I built this line-following robot as part of our \"Embedded Systems and IoT\" project for the Spring 2025 semester.\nOur project has been accepted at the 2025 International Conference on Quantum Photonics, Artificial Intelligence, and Networking (QPAIN), and we are thrilled to share the key aspects of our research with everyone today.\nThe Problem:\nResearch shows that medication errors—whether incorrect administration or failure to receive medication on time—are a major cause of deteriorating patient health. This risk is significantly higher for elderly patients or those suffering from dementia. Furthermore, due to the excessive workload on nurses and hospital staff, delays or errors in manual medication distribution are unfortunately common.\nOur Solution: MediBot\nMediBot is a smart line-following robot capable of delivering medication to specific hospital wards or beds completely autonomously. It is not just a robot; rather, it is an IoT-based ecosystem that stays connected with nurses or caregivers in real-time.\nHow Does It Work? (Technical Aspects)\nOur system is primarily composed of three main parts: 1. Navigation System: The robot uses Infrared (IR) sensors and a line-following algorithm for movement. By following a designated path (black line) on the hospital floor, it reaches specific patient beds. 2. Medicine Dispensing Mechanism: There is a hexagonal rotating container on top of the robot. Driven by a servo motor, it rotates to dispense medication from the correct compartment. 3. Communication & Alert System: This is our robot's smartest feature. Upon delivering the medication, it immediately sends a signal to the cloud server via an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module.\nHardware Used:\n• Microcontroller: Arduino Uno (acts as the brain).\n• Connectivity: ESP8266 (Wi-Fi module).\n• Sensors: IR Sensors (for path detection).\n• Motor Driver: L298N and Gear Motors.\n• Power: 12V Li-ion Battery.\nSoftware Stack: We used React.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. MongoDB is used as the database. Upon successful medication delivery, notifications are instantly sent to the nurse's or doctor's mobile phone and web dashboard via OneSignal or Firebase.\nWhy is MediBot Unique?\nThere are many smart pillboxes on the market that only provide reminders but do not physically deliver the medicine to the patient. Conversely, there are many line-following robots that merely carry items. MediBot combines these two functions:\n• Fully Automated Delivery: Nurses do not need to walk around carrying medicine.\n• Real-Time Tracking: Whether the medicine arrived on time can be monitored directly in the app.\n• Safe: There is no need for human contact with infectious patients.\n• Accuracy: In our testing phase, it demonstrated an accuracy rate of over 95%.\nFuture Work\nCurrently, this is functioning as a prototype. In the future, we plan to add several more features:\n• Obstacle Avoidance: Using ultrasonic sensors to navigate through crowds without collisions.\n• Elevator Integration: The ability to move from one floor to another.\n• Biometric Security: Ensuring that no one other than the specific patient can access the medication.\n• Temperature Control: A cooling system for sensitive medications like insulin or vaccines.\nResearch Team\nThe tireless hard work of our team is involved in making this project a success:\n• Jubair Amin Siyum\n• Ishmak Rahat Rafi\n• Md. Hasan Jarif Bin Monohor\n• Shakib\n• Md. Sadat Alam Protik\n• Supervisor: Md. Taslim Arif (Senior Lecturer, DIU)\nOur goal is to make healthcare easier and safer through the touch of technology. \nPaper Reference: 2025 International Conference on Quantum Photonics, Artificial Intelligence, and Networking (QPAIN), Rangpur, Bangladesh.\nView more here: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medibot-medicine-update-info.netlify.app\">https://medibot-medicine-update-info.netlify.app</a>",
